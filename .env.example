# Davinci Sequencer Environment Variables
# These variables correspond to the command-line flags in cmd/davinci-sequencer/main.go

# Private key to use for the Ethereum account (required)
# No default - must be provided
DAVINCI_WEB3_PRIVKEY=

# Network to use (available: sepolia, eth, geth, etc.)
# Default: sepolia
DAVINCI_WEB3_NETWORK=sepolia

# Web3 RPC endpoint(s), comma-separated
# Default: Uses endpoints from chainlist.org if not provided
DAVINCI_WEB3_RPC=

# Web3 Consensus API endpoint, necessary for State sync
# Default: Uses an endpoint from publicnodes
DAVINCI_WEB3_CAPI=

# Gas price multiplier for Ethereum transactions (EIP-4844 blob transactions)
# This multiplier is applied to both execution gas and blob gas fee caps
# Default: 1.2 (20% increase over base estimation for better reliability)
# Examples:
#   1.0 = Use base gas estimation (baseFee * 2 + tipCap)
#   1.2 = 20% increase (default, recommended for reliable inclusion)
#   1.5 = 50% increase for faster inclusion during moderate congestion
#   2.0 = Double gas prices for urgent transactions during high congestion
#   5.0 = 5x gas prices for very urgent transactions
# Valid range: 0.1 to 100.0
# Use higher values during network congestion to avoid stuck transactions
DAVINCI_WEB3_GASMULTIPLIER=1.2

# Custom process registry contract address (overrides network default)
# Default: Uses the address defined in the selected network configuration
DAVINCI_WEB3_PROCESS=

# Custom organization registry contract address (overrides network default)

# Custom results registry contract address (overrides network default)
# Default: Uses the address defined in the selected network configuration
DAVINCI_WEB3_RESULTS=

# API host to bind the server to
# Default: 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
DAVINCI_API_HOST=0.0.0.0

# API port to listen on
# Default: 9090
DAVINCI_API_PORT=9090

# URL seed for worker authentication (enables master worker endpoints)
# No default - leave empty to disable worker support
# When set, master will accept worker connections at /workers/{uuid} endpoint
DAVINCI_API_WORKERSSEED=

# Sequencer batch time window in seconds
# Default: 5m
DAVINCI_BATCH_TIME=5m

# Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
# Default: info

# Data directory for database and storage files (overwritten by docker compose)
# Default: ~/.davinci
# DAVINCI_DATADIR=

# ========== WORKER MODE CONFIGURATION ==========
# The following variables are used when running in worker mode

# Example: http://sequencer:9090/workers/<UUID>
# No default - must be provided to enable worker mode
DAVINCI_WORKER_SEQUENCERURL=

# Worker auth token to connect to the sequencer (required for worker mode)
DAVINCI_WORKER_AUTHTOKEN=

# Maximum time a worker can hold a job before timeout
# Default: 1m
DAVINCI_WORKER_TIMEOUT=1m

# ========== WEB DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION ==========
# The following variables are used to configure the web UI dashboard
#
# Set the default API provider for the dashboard
# It is only effective on build time
SEQUENCER_API_URL=http://localhost:9090

# The URL to the block explorer for the network
# This is used to link to transactions and contracts in the web UI
# Default: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address
BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL=https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address

# If running with docker compose and profile=prod, a domain is required
# in order to fetch the TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt
